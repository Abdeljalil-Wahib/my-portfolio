export const myWhyText = "I've always been fascinated by how ideas transform into something people can see, touch, and interact with. For me, front-end development isn't just about writing code — it's about crafting experiences that feel intuitive and enjoyable. I love solving problems where design and technology meet: making interfaces that look great, load fast, and work for everyone. Accessibility, performance, and smooth user interaction are things I take seriously — because the best products don't just function, they connect."

export const myJourneyText = "My tech journey started in 3D modeling and interactive environments. I earned my 3D Modeler & Unity Developer certificate from IDC Morocco, where I learned how design, animation, and interactivity work together to create immersive worlds. That curiosity naturally expanded into the web — a space where creativity meets a global audience.Today, I'm a student at 1337, part of the 42 school network, where I've been sharpening my problem-solving skills through projects that push me to think algorithmically, write efficient code, and adapt to new challenges quickly. From immersive 3D worlds to sleek user interfaces, my goal has stayed the same: build things that people love to use."

export const myPhilosophyText = "I learn by doing, tackling challenges head-on, and breaking complex problems into manageable steps. I focus on building practical solutions first, refining them along the way. Coding for me isn't just about writing lines — it's about understanding systems, thinking ahead, and creating tools and experiences that work seamlessly. I thrive when I combine logic with creativity, keeping the end goal in sight while staying open to learning at every step."

export const whatImLearning = "Right now, I'm diving deeper into backend development with Node.js and Express, building solid APIs and mastering server-side logic. At the same time, I'm exploring UI/UX enhancements—especially animations and interactive experiences—with Framer Motion. Every project is a chance to experiment, improve, and create something that's both functional and enjoyable to use."

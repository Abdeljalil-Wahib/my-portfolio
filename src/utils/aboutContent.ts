export const myWhyText = "I've always been fascinated by how ideas transform into something people can see, touch, and interact with. For me, front-end development isn't just about writing code — it's about crafting experiences that feel intuitive and enjoyable. I love solving problems where design and technology meet: making interfaces that look great, load fast, and work for everyone. Accessibility, performance, and smooth user interaction are things I take seriously — because the best products don't just function, they connect."

export const myJourneyText = "My tech journey started in 3D modeling and interactive environments. I earned my 3D Modeler & Unity Developer certificate from IDC Morocco, where I learned how design, animation, and interactivity work together to create immersive worlds. That curiosity naturally expanded into the web — a space where creativity meets a global audience.Today, I'm a student at 1337, part of the 42 school network, where I've been sharpening my problem-solving skills through projects that push me to think algorithmically, write efficient code, and adapt to new challenges quickly. From immersive 3D worlds to sleek user interfaces, my goal has stayed the same: build things that people love to use."
